Still working on getting everything squared away:

Completed items:
    getting all necessary food information from nutritionix api
    parsing foods into a matrix
    we know how to use cvxopt

Unfinished items:
    need to incorporate upper and lower bounds on each macro and micro nutrient into the matrix format
    need to decide with the objective function should be
    need to optimize our diet!
